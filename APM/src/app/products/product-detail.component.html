         we have a problem with this code, you know that HTTP is async, this means that our page could attempt to display the product's
         name before the product is retrieved, at that point the product property is undefined, 
         so we will get run time error telling us it can not read the property product name.
         in order to solve this problem we used above ngIf-->
        {{pageTitle + ': ' + product.productName}}
    </div>
