         we have a problem with this code, you know that HTTP is async, this means that our page could attempt to display the product's

         so we will get run time error telling us it can not read the property product name.
         in order to solve this problem we used above ngIf-->
        {{pageTitle + ': ' + product.productName}}
    </div>

        <button class='btn btn-outline-secondary' (click)='onBack()' style='width: 80px;'>

        </button>
